### Multiple mathematical analysis equations code in CPP, VC++ and CL.
* Codes are from multiple sources including Stackoverflow and a few of mine
* the sources address how to compile them using gcc or other,

- Matrix methods
- Kernels of some sort
- Stokes method
- Newton method
- Interpolations of many kinds
- Spherical mapping
- Riccati solvers
- ODEs
- Multiprecision calculus
- Wavefunctions
- Cholesky.
- Cardan method
- Kabsch, Gram Schmidt, others
- Lapack, Arpack, Armadillo, Eigen and ArrayFire sources
- Python ODEs, Linear algebra, multiphysics solvers and more.
- Straight SIMD vectorization from C and others.
